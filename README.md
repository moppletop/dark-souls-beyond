# Dark Souls Beyond

This is the work in progress website for the Dark Souls TTRPG by SteamForgeGames.
This app does not run out-the-box as it requires JSON files placed in `source/...` for class, item, option, origin and spell data.

## Known problems/things to improve

- Lack of testing
- Reorganisation of packages
- Move away from storing user options as strings.
- Import items, spells etc... into the database
- Move away from referring to multiple pages as "root"
- Implement actual user password encryption
