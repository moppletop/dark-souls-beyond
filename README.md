# Dark Souls Beyond

This is the work in progress website for the Dark Souls TTRPG by SteamForgeGames.
This app does not run out-the-box as it requires JSON files placed in `source/...` for class, item, option, and spell data.

It's also worth noting that I have made significant changes to the game for running at my table, certain mechanics I've
just removed (such as origins) and made my own decisions due to ambiguity from the book or because there's things I just
don't like.

## Known problems/things to improve

- Lack of testing
- Reorganisation of packages
- Move away from storing user options as strings.
- Import items, spells etc... into the database
- Move away from referring to multiple pages as "root"
- Implement actual user password encryption
